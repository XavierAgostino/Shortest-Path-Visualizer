# Shortest Path Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web application for visualizing Dijkstra's algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm in action. Built to make graph algorithms more accessible and easier to understand through visual representation.

## Motivation

While studying for Harvard's COMPSCI 1240 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) Midterm, I found myself struggling to fully understand the nuances of shortest path algorithms by just reading textbooks or watching lecture videos. I searched for interactive tools that could help me visualize these algorithms step-by-step, but couldn't find any that matched what I needed.

So I decided to build one myself! This project was born out of a genuine need to better understand these fundamental algorithms through visualization, and I'm sharing it in the hope that it can help other students facing similar challenges.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Clearly see how algorithms traverse graphs to find shortest paths
- **Two Algorithm Implementations**:
  - Dijkstra's algorithm (for graphs with non-negative edge weights)
  - Bellman-Ford algorithm (handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles)
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Watch algorithms progress one step at a time with detailed explanations
- **Dynamic Data Structure Visualization**: 
  - See priority queues and distance arrays update in real-time
  - Visualize iterations and negative cycle detection for Bellman-Ford
- **Graph Creation Options**:
  - Auto-generate random graphs with configurable parameters
  - Manual mode for creating custom graphs from scratch
  - Control edge density, node count, and weight ranges
- **Educational Features**:
  - Algorithm reference guide with pseudocode
  - Color-coded edges and nodes to indicate algorithm state
  - Detailed explanations at each step

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Lodash

## Installation and Usage

### Live Demo
The easiest way to try the application is through the live demo:
**[shortest-path-visualizer-pi.vercel.app](https://shortest-path-visualizer-pi.vercel.app)**

### Local Setup
If you prefer to run the application locally:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0 or higher)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shortest-path-visualizer.git
   cd shortest-path-visualizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### How to Use

1. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose between Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford
2. **Set Up a Graph**: 
   - Use auto-generate mode with custom parameters, or
   - Switch to manual mode to create your own graph
3. **Visualization Controls**:
   - Start: Begin the animation
   - Step: Move through the algorithm one step at a time
   - Reset: Clear the current execution
   - Show: Skip to the final result
4. **Learn**: Read the explanations for each step and refer to the algorithm reference
